# Welcome to the Docs

Here you will find some more in depth information on the library and how to use it as well as some information
on how it all works under the hood if you wanted to mess with it or build upon it.

Just click on the relevent files above to select the topic you are interested in.

(Assuming you are viewing this folder in github)

## Additional Technical Documentation

There is technical documentation available however it is not really needed when you can access the source directly,
if you do however want to generate it you can clone and run `gulp generate:documentation`. This will then output the
`technical` folder into this directory which contains some technical documentation to go with the source code.
